# Java Code Collection

This repository contains a variety of Java programming codes that have been written over time for learning and experimentation purposes. The codes range from simple exercises to more complex implementations demonstrating different concepts in Java programming.

## About Java

Java is a widely-used, object-oriented programming language known for its portability across platforms thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is used in web applications, enterprise software, mobile apps (Android), and much more. Java emphasizes readability, maintainability, and robustness.

## Types of Code in this Repository

- **Basic Syntax and Control Structures:** Examples covering variables, data types, loops, and conditional statements.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Implementation of common data structures like arrays, lists, stacks, and algorithms such as sorting and searching.
- **File Handling and Input/Output:** Programs demonstrating how to read from and write to files.
- **Miscellaneous Utilities and Small Projects:** Various utilities and small Java projects for practical learning.

## How to Work with Java Code

To run and compile Java code on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK):**  
   Download and install the latest JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).

2. **Compile Java Code:**  
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `.java` files, and compile the code using:  
javac FileName.java


3. **Run Java Program:**  
After compiling, run the program with:  

java FileName

4. **Using an IDE:**  
Alternatively, you can use Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans to write, compile, and run Java code more easily.
